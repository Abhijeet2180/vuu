CJS:

--Calculated Columns

- can be local to viewport in my humble (i.e. in CreateViewPortRequest I can add a column definition that will get parsed
- or can be statically defined in the table def

-static definition is easy
-dynamic (vp) definition, it would be cool to do something like this:

  CalculatedColumns = [
    MyColumn    = "bid - ask"          // this would need to be inferred that it is a math operation
    MyColumn2   = "ric + currency"     //this would need to be inferred to be a concat operation
    MyColumn3   = "average(bid)"       //these type of operations would also be cool
    MyColumn4   = "max(bid)"
    MyColumn5   = "min(bid)"
  ]

A more interesting question, is would we support
stuff like "min(bid) + (ask * fxToGBP)" and other more complicate math's bits...
